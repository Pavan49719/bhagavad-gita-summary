(Same excuses we give for not entering the Spiritual life)

Solution: Self-conquest is the greatest of victories.

### Order of Shastras
Bhakti shastra >> Darma shastra > Artha shastra

(Yudhisthira went to hell because he chose Dharma shastra over Bhakti shastra)



## 2nd chapter - Synopsis (Summary of the Gita)

### Eternal nature:
- Body - Already dead
- Soul - Never dies

### If we try our best in devotion (Bhakti)
- Fail -> will get heaven -> rebirth -> retry bhakti 
- Success -> will get vaikunth 
That's why we should never hesitate to do bhakti because eventually bhakti will take us to Vaikuntha.


### Sakam karmayog (karmakand level) 
- Helps to go to heaven
- These people are attracted with the fruits of their actions.
- These are short knowledge people. 
- Sakam karmayog is mentioned in the Gita so that people can develop some faith in shastras.

### Nishkam karmayog
- The person is not attracted with the fruits of his actions
- Gives all the fruits to the God
- But these people are driven more by their psycho physical nature.
- These people do what they like to do and not what is required to be done in the service of God.

### Karma
- Bad karma -> Hell (Poison)
- Good karma -> Heaven (Sugar coated poison)
- Akarma (Devotion) -> Vaikuntha (No poison at all)

### Happiness in different worlds
- Material world - Happiness & sadness both together
- Heaven - Temporary happiness
- Formless truth (Nirakar Brahma) - Long but still temporary happiness
- Vaikuntha - Permeant happiness
